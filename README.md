# new-site
This will be the succesor sight to godalming123.github.io and will eventually be what people first see when they look at that sight instead of my blog. I will first rename godalming123.github.io to old-site make a note in the readme as to what it used to be and archive it. I will then rename this repo to godalming123.github.io and make an update in the readme telling you this change has happened.
